# Visualizing Earthquake Data with Leaflet

## Background

The United States Geological Surve (USGS) is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. Their hope is that being able to visualize their data will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding..) on issues facing our planet.

Data source:
[USGS GeoJSON Feed](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) 

Created a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from your data set based on their longitude and latitude.

Used data markers to reflect the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes  appear larger and darker in color.

Added legend to  provide context of the map data.

Illustrated the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity.

Added a number of base maps and overlays that can be turned on and off independently and layer controls to the map.
